<head>NOTICE TO OUR READERS.</head>
<p>The “Egyptian Garotte" arrive* in Cairo every
night at 7.30 p.m and the hou*e to-house
delivery of the paper to onr subscribers begii ■
at 9 p.m. All oomplaints a* to delay in receiv-
ing tho "Gazette'' should bo addressed to the
I/ical Director of tho Cairo Post Offioe. A
number of oomplaints would be obviated if
letter-boxes were put up at the main entrances
of subscribers' houses.</p>
<p>Excellent arrangement*, brilliant decoration,
carriages, dogcarts, and what-not, beflowered
and begarlauded, deserved something better
than tho weather that chilled Cairo yesterday.
Tho moiniug was overcast till abont 10 a.m.,
then it cleared only for a cold and dust-laden
wind to bring the clouds up again, and-shortly
before 3 p.m. rain began to H. Thencefor-
ward showers came down intermittently till
close on 6 o'clock, and though it cleared later
the air was always raw and chilly.
The crowd of spectators was, none the less,
large and good-tempered. There wrs nothing
approaching an accident to chronicle, for the
polioe worked indefatigably with the oommittee
to keep the carriages in line and the publio
from nnder the wheels. And here we may state
that Major Vernon Jarvis and Capt Teoci
deserve great praise for the exoellent handling
of the prooeesion. The Gbexireh Casino, the
hotel avenue, and the paths roaod the lake
were gaily deoorated, at least three bonds were
playing, two as a rule together, the Inniskil-
lings iu the band-stand and the Blue Hunga-
rians in the casino, in front of which was the
semi-circular space reserved for the members
ol tbe committoo of ffitee, flanked by stands
which were full of spectators by 3 p.m. Other
stands from which and on which a heavy
: fusillade of flowers and oonfetti was kept up,
had been erected opposite the casino, and tea,
which was apparently much appreciated, was
served in the control hall of tho casino itself.*
It would be impossible to give a full and ac-
curate description of the deoorationa of the
motors, dog carts, carriages, and all kinds of
vehicle that circled round the casino between
8.20 and 6 p.m. Most of them were abund-
antly, some brilliantly,and a good few tastefully
deoorated.</p>
<p>“Hors Coneours” was Omar Boy 8ultan'a
tonneau, shaped like a swan, beautifully (loco
rated with white roees and lilac. Thon there
waa a hansom, belonging to Mr. Dallioo,
wreathed in green and violet, a viotoria deco-
rated with orange and purple, and anotboi
with powdere«f ooachmen and heaped with
white flowers, crowned by an am fall of white
roses, and docoreted with pale lemon yellow
ribbons, belonging to^M. Sursock, Khayat
Bay's motor with fan-shaped golden-grce-i
screen and parasol-shaped cover hung with
Chinese lanterns, a victoria begarlanded with
pink and white rosea; in which a very maje*tio
Indy held up a white dove perched on or at

aqd a (airfreight, oneof which bore amnshara
bieb, and M. Cattaoi’s brake, a mass o

Naturally enough, Cairo society, Euro
pean and native, was largely represent
ed,and had tho weather boon better the
gardens of the Ghezireh Palace would bavi
been even more crowded, aud also the terrace,
where multitudes of visitors had tea. Thi

<head>THE FITZNER QUARTETTE. W</head>
<p>The Fitxner Quartette gave their first oon- ei
oort at Cairo on the 3rd inst at the Continental
HoteL Tbe programme was exoellent end the
performance very good. Chamber music is so
infrequent in Cairo that adequate performances
thereof are a real godsend. Tho programme y
consisted of Mozart's quartette (B flat major), a w
largo by Smetana, a*cherzo(Braadta Buys), and
Beethoven’* quartette (Eminorop. 99 no. 2),"—a ^
raMtinterestingseleotion.TheMozartiapecnliar-
ly, delightful for its minuet and adagio, whioh
last was admirably rendered. There were jj
moments when the performers were perhaps I j,,
the least bit too energetic, too apt to “handle" n
tho music ; but they oertainly gave all the _
finish which this quartette requires. The ”
Brandts Buys sohorzo was dolightfuL both for
itself end for the rendering, and e most charm-
ing (one would almost say amusing) melody,
daintily given. The Smetana, on the other P
hand, was a carious, interesting piece, nnusoal «
for the individual treatment of the instra- E
meats and for the development of the »
phrases : it formed a strange o-mtrast to the 1
preceding and succeeding pieces. The BeethoTen fr
wa* ono of those quartettes to be grateful f<
for, a great quartett; the molto adagio is (
a splendid movement, and tho allegretto also. S
Here perhaps we might bint that there
was a suspioion of “roughness” in the treat- !
ment; the leader seemed shrill at times, almost "
too sudden in attaok. Let ns say at once that' j
Horr Walther is a most pleasing ’jelli»t: ho \
plays really artistically, and gives a groat
perfection of tone. As a last “enoore" and
favor, Boocherini's minuet in 'Sordini' was , T
given; and here perhaps the four executants t*
showed at their very best, presenting with the I _
utmost grmoe and delicaoy its delightful,"
haunting rhythm. We cannot refrain from |
expressing a wish that programmes should be
of somo “uon-orumpling" material; for instance,
cardboard 1 In a quartette the least sound or
rustle is more than notiooable: and, appre-
ciative as the audienM was, there were t
moments, especially at the very beginning of
movements, when there was a perceptible look '
of that absolute silenoo so necessary to bring £
•nt and enhanoe the attraction of chamber
music. We oertainly recommend all lovers of
musio to attend tho other perfonnanoes of
this quartette: we feel oonfident that they !
will be amply rewarded in the enjoyment r
proviaea tesreoy.</p>
