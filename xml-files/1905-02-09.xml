<head>“FEDOBA” AT THE ABBAS</head>
<head>SIGNA. BBLLINCIONI’8 SECOND
APPEARANCE.</head>
<p>The performance of Ftdora at the Abbas
Helmy Theatre yesterday evening, with Signa.
Bellincioni in the title rOle, was undoubtedly
an event in the local theatrioal world. A
more finished performance it would be im-
possible to imsgine on any stage, and the
result was a repetition of the great artiste’s
triumph of Saturday last Fedora is as exceed-
ing interesting opera, in that the orchestral
treatment is very distinct from that acoepted
in most works of the kind : it has a curious
reminisoonoe of Wagner, notably of Trittan,
in oertain parts. Tbe libretto, known to most
people through M. V. 8ardou, is certainly
calculated to furnish good dnmatio singing, and
no artiste is better fitted to bring ont to the
full the dramatio points with which it abounds
than Signora Bellincioni. Her performance
was one of tho most remarkable achievements
in the art of musio-drema that we have ever
witnessed. 8he knew bow to work towards a
climax, both in particular and in general,
when the first of all realised the imprisonment
of tie great depths of her passion, and wbon
she later realised the ripeness and fulness of
her ultimate despair. She was, in a word,
magnificent; and her every action betrayed
the consummate actress that she is. Tbe
womanly love and devotion to the husband
who is slain, her cunning in oompaasing her
terrible revenge, her passion for her lover,
are depioted with masterly skill and daring
fidelity. With what exqui«ite gentleness and
feeling she wins the affection of her lover;
with what overpowering force and majesty she
faces and vanquishes the murderer of her
husband! Tbe infinite pathos of the concluding
act, the pathetic picture of the desperate
woman who flies to poison as a relief from her
mental agony, with the face of a Madonna,
and the great, sad eyes full of a sorrow for
whioh thore can be no alleviation are, in truth,
things that no one who has witnessed them
will ever forget Fedora is a character that
exactly suits the tomperamont, the personality,
and the splendid taleqt of the great Italian
actress and singer. Sbo was well seoonded in
her trying rflle by Sig. Pagani aa Conte Loris,
as well as by the other performers. 8ig. Pagani
is a tenor with a future and shared in Signora
Bellincioni's great triumph. He sang with
taste aud no little dramatio power, although
at times he seemed rather nervous, which was
probably due to the prosenoe and personality
of Siguora Bellincioni. The orchestra did full
justioe to the beautiful music of the opera,
and tbo ohorus worked well. Tho staging ol
the opera left nothing to be desired, both the
scenery and costumes being exoelleat. Signora
Bollincioni's dresses were nothing less than
superb.</p>
<head>DEVELOPMENT OF FARSHUT.</head>
<p>Our Farshut Correspondent states that the
Postmaster-General has decided to open a
branch of the postoffice savings bank at
Farshut in consequence of the petition ot the
inhabitants, whioh be voioed in our columns.
The inhabitants are delighted with Saba
Pasha’s promptness in hearkening to their
wishes.
The employes of tbe Corporation of Western
Egypt are still hoping that the Railway
Administration will grant their request and
stop the “train de luxe'"at Farshut station.</p>
<head>HELOUAN RAILWAY.</head>
<p>Since the Dolta Light Railway Company has
taken over the Cairo-Helouan lino, great
satisfaction has boen evinced at tbo reforms
that tbe company has introduoed. We extract
the following passage from our vernacular
ouutemporary "Misr”:
Wo are requested by several peoplo inhabit-
ing Helouan to express their warmest thanks
for the many aud various reforms brought
about by tbe Delta Company on the lino which
before long they oxpect to become one of the
most orderly and the least dangerous of lines.
Tbo reason that some are conducting a virulent
campaign against the company, despite its
recent existence, is due to the mere bet that
they are uot willing to squander money in the
samo way as the former oompany with the
view to preventing hypocrites from exhibiting
their crying and manifold defeats. Tho object
of tbe now oompany is reforms in the full
sense of the word, and no babbling or nonsense
whatever on tbe part of ill-intentioned people
is to deter thorn from attaining this moat
commendable object.</p>

London, February 8.
The present week has been characterised by
cheerfulness in oar Stock Markets, owing in a
great measure io the growing belief that Russia
cannot much longer continue the war, and
also to tho hope that the Tsar ia beginning to
Have hjs own way in reierenoe to the reforms.

making the moat of the amelioration- of the
trouble in 8t Petersburg and have hoisted up
the prioe of Russian Four* to over 20 again.
Ot stock* and share* then ia little to report
this week of interest, to your readen. Am far
as the mining section is oonoeroed, business in
South Africans nosms to be at a coesplete
standstill at promt, with a drooping tendency
in price*. Egyptian mining properties, unlike
the other Egyptian companies, are not yet
independent and are still under tbe wing of
the South African Market, and consequently
they suffer wiih Kaffirs when the Utter are
weak. Nile Valley, have dropped to 2.1/lti
at the present moment, a prioe whieb may
tempt speculative investors,, AM forgetting
that the oompany is to a Urge extent in the

United Africans at 1.9/16 shoeid be worth
attention. It is evident that the market
anticipate an motive future; for a special book
of referenoe has just been published, “The
Egypt and Sudan Mining Handbook.” Other
Egyptian stocks are steady and hold their
prtoes well generally. Bonk shares are a strong
point, especially National Banks, whioh are in
tmmand at 26 in anticipation of th* dividend.
The market expects a distribution of 15s. per
share. Some aay under, but 15a. is the general
idea. Agricultural* are firm at 10 7/8, other
pnoee are steady with little or no change on
Uie week, except %yptian Markets, whioh

Russians, which they manage to keep np to

of this stock oomes out at this prioe, for it
certainly should tempt holders. Japanese stocks
keep strong. Money is cheap and the investment
market is strong, though not an actire ope, and

<head>MISS HOESLI’8 CONCERT.</head>
<p>Miss Hoesli’s conoert at the New Khedivial
Total last night was a great success. There
vas a large audience in spite of the bad
veather. The talonted Swiss lady was assisted
>y the distinguished amateurs, Messra. Fos-
jolo, Jaoot des Combes, Weedon, and Ehrlich,
rbe concert began with Handel's well-known
Largo in G Major, sung by Mias Hoesli, assist-
by Mr. Ehrlich at the piano and Mr. Weedon
arith the violin. Mias Hoeali's voioe was
beautifully modulated to suit this diffioult
piece. It was much applauded by a critical
sudieuoe. M. Fasoolo followed with a violin
duet by Sinving, in whioh be was assisted
by a friend, whose name was not on the
programme. This intricate pieoe was executed
with marvellous facility. Tbe sooompaniment
wss cleverly given by Mrs. Foeoolo. Three
romances were next sung by Miss Hoesli, An
Die Nsoht (Bohm), Chant Hindoo (Bembcrg),
and Liebesleier (Weingartner).. The last item
was especially appreciated and was given with
great depth of feeling and perfect harmony.
Beethoven’s Adagio was well given by Messrs.
Weedon, Des Combes, and Bhrlioh, followed
by two solos by Mr. Fusoolo. Sohubert's
L'Abeillo was exoellently played and had to
be given again to satisfy the demands for an
enoore. Mias Hoesli then sang Xavier Le-
ronx's Lo Nil, accompanied by M. Dee
Combes on tbo 'cello and Mr. Ehrlich on the
piano. Tho 'cello adapted itself very well to
Miss Hoesli’s powerful voioe. Tho oonoert,
which closed with three romances sung by Miss
Hoesli, again showed the variety of that lady’s
talents, and the bouquets and applause she
received showed bow muoh her splendid vocal
gifts are appreciated by tho connoisseurs of
Alexandria.</p>
