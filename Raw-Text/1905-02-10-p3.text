KHEDIVIAL OPERA HOUSE.
t	FEDORA.
‘ n* performance of Fedora at tho Kbedivial
3 Opera House last night, thanks to 8igna.
3 Pandotfini, was a great success. Signa. Pan-
. dolfiui ba thorough artiste and an actresa
J of • rmy high order. Her rendering of Fedora
^ was, if possihlo, better than her Tosco. 8ignor
Giraud wu variable, though undoubtedly good
in the last act; hit singing in the second act
was irotRt all that we should have wished :
he sang more than onoo sharp (one natural
wae-turaad into sharp!) and did not always
seem to "have hold" of his note. Inaccuracies
were numeroas and hardly justified, and he
seems to have a difficulty in taking really
high notes. We may mention a most admirable
high C by Signa. Pandolfini. Signor Rubini
delivered his solo very effectively in Act
I. Signor Polese was good and sang well, but
he has not the same chance as in La Tosco-, he
is a real chef de polioe, and as such probably
finds diplomacy too tame an occupation. The
chorus is unusually good, and this Kbedivial
Theatre have—in that branch—spent their
money to real advantage. Indeed, in theatrical
■'accessories" Cairo need not fear competition,
so long as the present conditions are in fort*.
RigoUtto is to be given to-night We hope
that some improvement will be effected therein.
In this connection it is interesting to note that
in Alexandria—as in' Cairo—Signor Tomisani
seems to bave scored a brilliant success in that
opera. Though our fellow critics may take
exception to bis methods, a glance at tbe toores
of the operas in which he sings will show that
he "bandies" bis high notes with an ease and
dexterity apparently foreign to bis better-
known rivals of tbo State Theatre. Whatever
bis compatriots may think of his “tone,” it
undoubtedly pleases the Anglo-8axon in ge-
neral ; and we could wish that—but we are
criticising the Kbedivial Theatre, and it is as
well to remind our readers that Siberia, also
by Giordano (who*o compositions seem to be
above the average) will be gi - en on Saturday,
j Lot ti» mention, before we dose, that Signora
s Tromben really showed to advantage in her
e part Aa long as great and startling efforts are
B not required of her, she is quite pleasing.

A BBDODIN OUTRAGE.
EUROPEAN ATTACKED NEAR SUEZ,
a	(Prom our Correspondent.)
y	Suez, February 9.
A European named'Gilbert, who h*d foiled
s to find employment at Suez, decided to go to
i- Suakin, and not haring money to pay his pas-
t sage, set out ou the 25th January last en route
for Suakin on toot His belongings he carried
on bis back in a bag which contained papers
of identity, certificates, a knife, paper, pen and
pencil*, the sum of P.T. 9J, a pair of boots,
and some clothe*. Por provisions he had only a
J beg hf sea biacnits and he carried two empty
l. water bottlee. On the morning of the 27th
i- January, after having passed the Attaka
s mountains, he encountered near the shore
j about half-a-dozen native fishermen, who
r received him oordially and gave him fish and
i	bread to eat. After a good rest, Gilbert
t prooeeded in the direction of tho mountains,
: where he took shelter for the night.
J Early on the following day, ha descended
s the mountains and wooton his way, meeting with
s no untoward incident, but next day, at about
e noon, he encountered two Bedouin*, whom he
y asked for water. The latter gave him to nndcr-
a stand that if he followed them they would
j take him to some wells, which the traveller
t did without the slightest suspicion. On th*
t way he made them aware of the foot that lge
a was a poor man, and that on aooount of this
y he was obliged to walk to Suakiu in order
e to find employment.
d	After eeveral hours' walk, seeing no trace of
ir water, and being exhausted, he proposed that
J they should all have a rest, and accordingly sat
i, down on a rock. Suddenly the younger ol the
Bedouins, who was at a distance of about 50
« yards from Gilbert, began to swear at him, and,
i. raising his gun,fired>Gilbert was slightly wound-
,t ed in the beck, but his bag prevented a serious
ii	wound. Tbe Bedouin afterwards reloaded bis
,t gun and asked Gilbert to place all his belong-
e ings at a certain spot. This was done without
ss hesitation. While the Bedouin waa oocupied
it with his gun, Gilbert managed to creep from
d rock to rook, and, favored by the darknese,
r- succeedod in oludingthe Bedouins. After a long
ir inarch tbe whole of the night be arrived at
it daybreak at a small ooast guard statioo, where
s. he was well received. Here be remained till the
-e 1st inst, when he kas offered a camel, and, in
ls company of a ooast guard named Mahmoud,
o ho reached the Attaka mountains, where there
« is a ooast guard station. The Governor of Suez
f, w-u at once advised of tbe matter, and,
-a accompanied by the chief of the police, a doctor,
•r and several gendarmes, prooeeded to the spot
-o to hold an enquiry. Finally, Gilbert was con-
veyed to the French Hospital at Suez, where
he still remains, on aooount of his wounds.
